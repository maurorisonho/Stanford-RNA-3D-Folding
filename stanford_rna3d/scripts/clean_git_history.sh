Git History Cleaner - Standardize commit messages
=================================================

This script cleans the Git history by removing or sanitizing commit messages
that include work-in-progress markers, fixup prefixes, or other inconsistent
patterns from the repository history.

[WARNING]  WARNING: This script rewrites Git history and is DESTRUCTIVE!
Make sure you have backups before running this script.

Usage: bash clean_git_history.sh

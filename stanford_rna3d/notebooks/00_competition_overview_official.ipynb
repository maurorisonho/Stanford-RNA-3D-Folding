    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Stanford RNA 3D Folding** competition! This challenge focuses on solving RNA structure prediction, one of biology's remaining grand challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competition Summary\n",
    "- **Host**: Stanford University\n",
    "- **Type**: Featured Code Competition\n",
    "- **Duration**: ~7 months (Feb 27 - Sep 24, 2025)\n",
    "- **Prize Pool**: $75,000\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA is vital to life's most essential processes, but despite its significance, predicting its 3D structure is still difficult. Deep learning breakthroughs like AlphaFold have transformed protein structure prediction, but progress with RNA has been much slower due to limited data and evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, you'll develop machine learning models to predict an RNA molecule's 3D structure from its sequence. The goal is to improve our understanding of biological processes and drive new advancements in medicine and biotechnology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition builds on recent advances, like the deep learning foundation model RibonanzaNet, which emerged from a prior Kaggle competition. Now, you'll take on the next challenge—predicting RNA's full 3D structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work could push RNA-based medicine forward, making treatments like cancer immunotherapies and CRISPR gene editing more accessible and effective. More fundamentally, your work may be the key step in illuminating the folds and functions of natural RNA molecules, which have been called the 'dark matter of biology'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition is made possible through a worldwide collaborative effort including the organizers, experimental RNA structural biologists, and predictors of the CASP16 and RNA-Puzzles competitions; Howard Hughes Medical Institute; the Institute of Protein Design; and Stanford University School of Medicine."

    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### TM-score (\"Template Modeling\" Score)\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are scored using **TM-score**, which goes from 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{TM-score} = \\max \\left( \\frac{1}{L_{ref}} \\sum_{i=1}^{L_{ref}} \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{d_i}{d_0}\\right)^2} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $L_{ref}$ is the number of residues solved in the experimental reference structure (\"ground truth\")\n",
    "- $L_{align}$ is the number of aligned residues\n",
    "- $d_i$ is the distance between the $i_{th}$ pair of aligned residues, in Angstroms\n",
    "- $d_0$ is a distance scaling factor in Angstroms, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_0 = 0.6(L_{ref} - 0.5)^{1/2} - 2.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $L_{ref} ≥ 30$; and $d_0 = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6$, or $0.7$ for $L_{ref} <12, 12-15, 16-19, 20-23$, or $24-29$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alignment Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation and translation of predicted structures to align with experimental reference structures are carried out by **US-align**. To match default settings, as used in the CASP competitions, the alignment will be sequence-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "For each target RNA sequence, you will submit 5 predictions and your final score will be the average of best-of-5 TM-scores of all targets. For a few targets, multiple slightly different structures have been captured experimentally; your predictions' scores will be based on the best TM-score compared to each of these reference structures."

    "- **2nd Place** - $15,000\n",
    "- **3rd Place** - $10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Sharing Prizes\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants of this competition are encouraged to make publicly available their notebooks through the competition. There will be a refresh of the public leaderboard 2 months after competition start. At that time, $2,500 will be awarded to the first two teams to publish a public notebook scoring above the `VFOLD_human_expert` score on the leaderboard. A discussion post will detail timing of the refresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements for Early Sharing Prize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Publish a public notebook scoring above the benchmark score on the leaderboard after the data refresh (first two notebooks that meet this criteria will be evaluated).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Out of all participants or Teams who have submitted notebooks scoring above the benchmark score, be the first two to make your notebooks public. The public notebook needs to adhere to the same requirements and restrictions regarding licensing, reproducibility, and documentation to which the winning Submission is subject (see Competition Rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Keep the notebooks and any datasets they use publicly available until the **Final Submission Deadline** of May 29, 2025. Submissions should only make use of information publicly available before the temporal cutoff dates provided with test sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paper Authorship\n",
    "\n",
    "Top performing participants on the Public Leaderboard rankings at the final submission deadline will be invited to contribute their code and model descriptions to a scientific paper summarizing the competition's scientific outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Competition Sponsor will, after the data refresh, assess all Submissions that are eligible for the Early Sharing Prize in the order in which Submissions were made. If it is discovered that such a Submissions that scored more than the benchmark score has no or incomplete documentation, incompatible licensing, or is in any other way incompatible with the rules to which the winning Submission is subject, it will not be considered towards the Early Sharing Prize and the next Submissions will be assessed."

    "### This is a Code Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions to this competition must be made through Notebooks. In order for the \"Submit\" button to be active after a commit, the following conditions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU Notebook** ≤ 8 hours run-time\n",
    "- **GPU Notebook** ≤ 8 hours run-time\n",
    "- **Internet access disabled**\n",
    "- **Freely & publicly available external data is allowed**, including pre-trained models\n",
    "- **Submission file must be named** `submission.csv`\n",
    "- **Submission runtimes have been slightly obfuscated**. If you repeat the exact same submission you will see up to 5 minutes of variance in the time before you receive your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Data Evaluation Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "The run-time limits for both CPU and GPU notebooks will be extended to during the future data evaluation period proportional to the number of future samples. You must ensure your submission completes within that time. The extra runtime will enable us to use a substantially larger test set as the basis for ranking submissions on the final private leaderboard.\n",
